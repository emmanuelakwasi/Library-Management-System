# 📚 Flask Library Management System (OOP + CSV)

**Created by Emmanuel A. Opoku**  
**Course:** CS 120 – Introduction to Computer Science  
**Institution:** Grambling State University

## Project Background

This project was developed as part of our **CS 120 class activities** this week, where we explored **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python and applied them to real-world applications using the **Flask web framework**.

Our goal was to design a simple yet functional **Library Management System** to replace the **traditional pen-and-paper process** currently used at the **Grambling State University Library**.  

By leveraging Flask and Python OOP, this system demonstrates how small-scale automation can make library operations — such as borrowing, returning, and tracking books — more efficient and reliable.

## Features
- Add, view, and delete **Books**
- Add, view, and delete **Members**
- **Borrow** and **Return** books
- Data persists in `data/*.csv` (simple database storage)
- Clean OOP models: `Book`, `Member`, and `Library`

## How to Run
1. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Notes
- Borrowing requires a valid `member_id`. Add members first via **Add Member** page.
- Book IDs and Member IDs should be unique.
- CSV files are created automatically with headers.

## Extend Ideas
- Add search & pagination
- Track due dates & fines
- Add a dropdown of members on the Books page (pre-populate from CSV)
- Switch CSV to SQLite for more robust storage
